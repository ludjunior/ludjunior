Hi there, My name is Lud. It's pronounced (Lood). 
I'm here because i'd like to contribute and help others who may be having the same problem or misunderstanding as i did when i started this journey. 
My intention is to post few projects here and hopefully you find them interesting and helpful.
The info here have to be verified in case of any changes or expiration. For ex: i may use an Amazon AMI and by the time you find it here it is no longer in use so make sure you 
check everything. 
You can leave me a comment here as well. If you like. I would like to know whether or not people find this helpful. 

I will be posting few projects here and there. So you can keep an eye for them. 


I hope you find these projects helpful and educational





Thanks, 

Lud
